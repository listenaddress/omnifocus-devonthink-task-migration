# omnifocus-devonthink-task-migration
A script to migrate tasks from an OmniFocus Document to folders that can be imported into DEVONThink

## Migration flow
1. Export your OmniFocus as an OmniFocus Document
2. Add that document to this repo's root folder
3. Run `migration.sh` (Answer "n" to any prompts)
4. Drag two folders just created into DEVONThink: Files and Projects
